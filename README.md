# Dog-Breed-Identification #
Data Science, Machine Learning Study Project 

## About ##
Dog’s breed identification project is made under the guidelines of the ‘Intro to data science’ course as a part of computer science bachelor.  
The idea for the project came after long brainstorming since one of the main requirements of the project was scraping/crawling the data, using pre-made datasets was restricted.

## Project planing ##
* Data acquisition (using scraping, crawling and API)
* EDA
* Machine Learning
* Deep learning
* CNN
* Image classification (using Tensorflow)

## Contributing ##
Project status: Data cleaning, Machine deep learning training
