# Dog-Breed-Identification
Data Science, Machine Learning Study Project 

About
Dog Breed Identification Prjoect is a part of Data Science, Machine Learning course for computer science bachelor degree.
In this project the students will show data analytics, data crawling and scraping, EDA, machine learning skills as learned in the course.
The idea for the project came after a long brainstorming and thinking outside the box in context of the course.
In this project all the scrapping and the crawling data was for eductional purpose only and not for distribution of any kind, copyright for the images going to:
